Webform Telephone
=================

This module provides a Telephone component/field type for Webform.

It's similar to the Telephone module in that it's lightweight on features. There is no validation of the entered text. In fact, unless you have the Elements module enabled, this will simply be a plain old textfield.

------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  <https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules>

How to use
----------

- Go to the main field list of a webform.
- Add a telephone element to your form.

Compatibility
